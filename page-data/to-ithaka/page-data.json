Cavafy</em>\n<br/><br/></p>\n<p>When you first see the title of this blog, you may be puzzled: why would I go to Ithaka? I was born and raised in Shanghai, attend university in Los Angeles, and have no friends or family ties to Ithaka whatsoever. But you're absolutely right - I'm not actually going to Ithaka. The truth is, this title was merely an idea suggested by the deareast friend and the greatest lifesaver for us college students, ChatGPT:\n<br/><br/>\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 700px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 10.285714285714286%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAYAAABYBvyLAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAaElEQVR42mWMQQqEMBAE/f+n9gme9ryezCSTScYFIROU1kTIxUPRFE339OMv5uWDv+5wRPA+dIh8h1kgkpBShup2e0TOOmje+hgFpRRMujNcXpBEsToaRyFwP26DWuvAzF5u9uRxnLgAf8OX0xriNggAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"How I asked ChatGPT for a title for my first blog\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/3194d37b08a924759c1a1f892799b35d/8c557/GPT.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3194d37b08a924759c1a1f892799b35d/4edbd/GPT.png 175w,\n/static/3194d37b08a924759c1a1f892799b35d/13ae7/GPT.png 350w,\n/static/3194d37b08a924759c1a1f892799b35d/8c557/GPT.png 700w,\n/static/3194d37b08a924759c1a1f892799b35d/e996b/GPT.png 1050w,\n/static/3194d37b08a924759c1a1f892799b35d/2cefc/GPT.png 1400w,\n/static/3194d37b08a924759c1a1f892799b35d/a4f81/GPT.png 1508w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n<br/>\nThis <em><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51296/ithaka-56d22eef917ec\">Ithaka</a></em> by C.P. Cavafy was among the many poems that the AI language model offered for me to consider. I chose it because you see, I've never written a blog before; I have tried to keep a diary or journal a couple of times in the past, though unfortunately, my enthusiasm for these endeavors never lasted beyond a few months. But I know this time is different- <em>Nah.</em> I know this blog thing is no more than another sudden impulse of mine and probably won't survive more than one quarter. <strong>But who cares?</strong> I hope the road is a long one, but doesn't matter if it's not. I'm taking the first step and having fun, and that's enough.\n<br/><br/>\nThat being said, there ARE some solid motivation behind this site.<br/>\n 1. I've got some time to kill before spring quarter starts (OK this one is not that solid).<br/>\n 2. I wanted to increase my familiarity with Gatsby, React, JavaScript, etc.<br/>\n 3. I was curious about Gatsby's Material-UI plugin and what it can achieve. I tried to install the plugin this winter but an error kept coming up so I gave up. But I've grown smart enough to resolve the error this time - the sticky footer on the homepage was created based on the template from Material-UI's website!<br/>\n 4. My ability to express complex ideas has dropped considerably ever since I came to the US, regardless of the language I am using. That's why I feel the need to push myself to write something.\n<br/><br/>\nSo sit back, relax, and join me on a different kind of journey—one without a clear destination but with the potential for exciting discoveries (so cliché). That's all for this blog, folks!\n<br/><br/>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 700px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.42857142857143%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Bocchi says she's going home\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/1f613b280369c0273a3fef7b441717b5/29d31/bocchi.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/1f613b280369c0273a3fef7b441717b5/e52aa/bocchi.jpg 175w,\n/static/1f613b280369c0273a3fef7b441717b5/70ebb/bocchi.jpg 350w,\n/static/1f613b280369c0273a3fef7b441717b5/29d31/bocchi.jpg 700w,\n/static/1f613b280369c0273a3fef7b441717b5/9ecec/bocchi.jpg 1050w,\n/static/1f613b280369c0273a3fef7b441717b5/d165a/bocchi.jpg 1400w,\n/static/1f613b280369c0273a3fef7b441717b5/977d5/bocchi.jpg 1701w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 01, 2023","slug":"/to-ithaka","title":"To Ithaka"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ecd79f57-aad6-578c-95b0-35eb15746d12","frontmatter__slug":"/to-ithaka","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"to-ithaka"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
