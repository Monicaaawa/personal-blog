Cavafy</em>\n<br/><br/></p>\n<p>When you first see the title of this blog, you may be puzzled: why would I go to Ithaka? I was born and raised in Shanghai, attend university in Los Angeles, and have no friends or family ties to Ithaka whatsoever. But you're absolutely right - I'm not actually going to Ithaka. The truth is, this title was merely an idea suggested by the deareast friend and the greatest lifesaver for us college students, ChatGPT.</p>\n<!-- <br/><br/>\n![How I asked ChatGPT for a title for my first blog](../images/GPT.png) -->\n<br/>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51296/ithaka-56d22eef917ec\">Ithaka</a> by C.P. Cavafy was among the many poems that the AI language model offered for me to consider. I chose it because you see, I've never written a blog before; I have tried to keep a diary or journal a couple of times in the past, though unfortunately, my enthusiasm for these endeavors never lasted beyond a few months. But I know this time is different- <em>Nah.</em> I know this blog thing is no more than another sudden impulse of mine and probably won't survive more than one quarter. <strong>But who cares?</strong> I hope the road is a long one, but doesn't matter if it's not. I'm taking the first step and having fun, and that's enough.\n<br/><br/>\nThat being said, there ARE some solid motivation behind this site.<br/>\n 1. I've got some time to kill before spring quarter starts (OK this one is not that solid).<br/>\n 2. I wanted to increase my familiarity with Gatsby, React, JavaScript, etc.<br/>\n 3. I was curious about Gatsby's Material-UI plugin and what it can achieve. I tried to install the plugin this winter but an error kept coming up so I gave up. But I've grown smart enough to resolve the error this time - the sticky footer on the homepage was created based on the template from Material-UI's website!<br/>\n 4. My ability to express complex ideas has dropped considerably ever since I came to the US, regardless of the language I am using. That's why I feel the need to push myself to write something.\n<br/><br/>\nSo sit back, relax, and join me on a different kind of journey—one without a clear destination but with the potential for exciting discoveries (so cliché). That's all for this blog, folks!</p>\n<!-- <br/><br/>\n<img src=\"../images/bocchi.jpg\" alt=\"Bocchi says she's going home\" style=\"width:10px\"> -->","frontmatter":{"date":"April 01, 2023","slug":"/to-ithaka","title":"To Ithaka"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ecd79f57-aad6-578c-95b0-35eb15746d12","frontmatter__slug":"/to-ithaka","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"to-ithaka"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
