*"As you set out for Ithaka<br>
hope your road is a long one,<br>
full of adventure, full of discovery." - Ithaka by C.P. Cavafy*
<br/><br/>

When you first see the title of this blog, you may be puzzled: why would I go to Ithaka? I was born and raised in Shanghai, attend university in Los Angeles, and have no friends or family ties to Ithaka whatsoever. But you're absolutely right - I'm not actually going to Ithaka. The truth is, this title was merely an idea suggested by the deareast friend and the greatest lifesaver for us college students, ChatGPT.

This [Ithaka](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51296/ithaka-56d22eef917ec) by C.P. Cavafy was among the many poems that the AI language model offered for me to consider. I chose it because you see, I've never written a blog before; I have tried to keep a diary or journal a couple of times in the past, though unfortunately, my enthusiasm for these endeavors never lasted beyond a few months. But I know this time is different- _Nah._ I know this blog thing is no more than another sudden impulse of mine and probably won't survive more than one quarter. **But who cares?** I hope the road is a long one, but doesn't matter if it's not. I'm taking the first step and having fun, and that's enough.
<br/><br/>
That being said, there ARE some solid motivation behind this site.<br/>
&nbsp;1. I've got some time to kill before spring quarter starts (OK this one is not that solid).<br/>
&nbsp;2. I wanted to increase my familiarity with Gatsby, React, JavaScript, etc.<br/>
&nbsp;3. I was curious about Gatsby's Material-UI plugin and what it can achieve. I tried to install the plugin this winter but an error kept coming up so I gave up. But I've grown smart enough to resolve the error this time - the sticky footer on the homepage was created based on the template from Material-UI's website!<br/>
&nbsp;4. My ability to express complex ideas has dropped considerably ever since I came to the US, regardless of the language I am using. That's why I feel the need to push myself to write something.
<br/><br/>
So sit back, relax, and join me on a different kind of journey—one without a clear destination but with the potential for exciting discoveries (so cliché). That's all for this blog, folks!
